            <b>Note that this is neither the original website nor the original archive of Engauge Digitizer.</b> The package was
            written and maintained by Markum Mitchell, however, some years ago all official repositories and these pages were
            removed from Github. The data has been restored from the Software Heritage Archive (including commit history),
            however, <b>I (Andreas K. HÃ¼ttel) will only perform minimal maintenance</b> and would be happy to pass it on to anyone
            who can invest more time and effort.

          <p>
	    The Engauge Digitizer tool accepts image files (like PNG, JPEG and TIFF) containing graphs, and recovers the
	    data points from those graphs. The resulting data points are usually used as input to other software applications.
	    Conceptually, Engauge Digitizer is the opposite of a graphing tool that converts data points to graphs. The process
	    is shown below - an image file is imported and then digitized within Engauge by placing points along axes and curves.
	    Data points can be transferred to other software applications by exporting to a text file, or directly using copy and
	    paste. Work can be saved into an Engauge DIG file for later editing.
	  </p>

	    <img width="692" height="289" src="images/ProcessFlowchart.png" alt="process flowchart" />
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Engauge users range from one-time users digitizing a single image file, to large government and commercial
	    organizations managing databases of thousands of image files.

		<p>Version 6.0 (10/23/2015) of Engauge 6 was released. This is a major rewrite of the 10 year old Engauge Digitizer 
		  software project that once lived on sourceforge.net. The replacement is required since the Qt3 toolkit that
		  Engauge relies on is disappearing. Engauge-Digitizer uses the new Qt5 library which should be available for
		  many years, and also offers many new features.</p>

	    <a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Engauge can be installed using repository packages for popular Linux distributions of Linux or the Mac App Store for OSX (easiest methods), or by downloading
	    pre-built binaries for Windows and Linux (slightly less easy). The pre-built binaries are available from the engauge-digitizer
	    project at github.com, in the <a href="https://github.com/markummitchell/engauge-digitizer/releases">Releases page</a>. The final option 
	    for installing is to build the software from the source
	    code (very difficult). Building the software from the source code is accomplished by following the steps in the BUILD
	    file that is found in the main directory. The build process can take as little as one hour in Linux or as long as 
	    several hours in Microsoft Windows.

Engauge Digitizer was written and maintained by Markum Mitchell, whose last project activity was in 2022
and who has in the meantime deleted the official Git repository. Here the files have been restored, 
with the intention to perform minimal maintenance to keep the software running. If you are interested
in more active maintenance or taking over the project, feel free to contact me and/or clone the files.
